Living life backwards quote
=============================
Woody Allen  
  

In my next life  
I want to live backwards.  
You start out dead  
and get that out of the way.  
Then you wake up in an old people's home  
feeling better every day.  
You get kicked out for being too healthy,  
go collect your pension,  
and then when you start work  
you get a gold watch  
and a party on your first day.  
You work for 40 years  
until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement.  
You part, drink alcohol,  
and are generally promiscuous,  
then you are ready for high school.  
You then go to primary school,  
You become a kid, you play,  
You have no responsibilities,  
You become a baby  
until you are born.  
And then you spend your last 9 months  floating in luxurious spa  
like conditions with central heating  and room service on tap  
larger quarters every day and then, Voila!  
You finish off as an orgasm!  
  
  

倒序人生
==============
伍迪·艾伦  
  

下辈子，我想倒着活一回。  
第一步就是死亡，然后把它抛在脑后。  
在敬老院睁开眼  
一天比一天感觉更好  
直到因为太健康被踢出去。  
领上养老金，然后开始工作  
第一天就得到一块金表，还有庆祝派对  
40年后，够年轻了，可以去享受退休生活了。  
狂欢，喝酒，恣情纵欲  
然后准备好可以上高中了。  
接着上小学  
然后变成了个孩子，无忧无虑地玩耍  
肩上没有任何责任  
不久，成了婴儿，直到出生。  
人生最后九个月，在奢华的水疗池里漂着  
那里有中央供暖，客房服务随叫随到  
住的地方一天比一天大，然后，哈！  
我在高潮中结束了一生！
