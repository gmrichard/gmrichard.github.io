　　In English, we have a saying that goes, “Use it or lose it.” It means that if you do not
continue to use a skill, you might lose the ability to do so.  

　　We can say this about language learning, including learning new words. If you do not
use the new words often, you might forget them.  

　　Our reader Banin has a question today. Here it is: Hi. How can I improve my
vocabulary? Hello Banin,　　

　　Great question! The answer will help many English learners. Here are four things you
can do:　　

　　Read...a lot! Look for news stories, websites, magazines and books on subjects that you
enjoy. While reading, try to guess the meanings of new words from their context. Then,
you can check the meanings in a paper dictionary or online.　　

　　If there are television shows or films that you love in English, watch them with English
subtitles to learn new words and hear how we say them.　　

　　But, don’t just read. Write! A great way to practice what you read is to write about it.
For example, if you read a web story about the best fitness apps of 2018, write about it.　　

　　Another thing you can write about what is you did today. If you spent time with a
friend or family member, went to an event, had a delicious meal or did something else,
write about it! Here’s another great technique:　　

　　When you learn a new word, learn its other forms. For example, the word “sleepy” is
an adjective. But it has noun, verb and adverb forms. You can make a word form chart in
a note book or wireless device and write a sentence example for each form.　　

　　Another powerful memory tool is word association: using your imagination to create
mental images linked to new words. For example, when I say, "tasty” what food image
do you see in your mind? Keep that food image in your mind and always mentally
connect it to the word “tasty.” Then, the next time you try to remember the word "tasty,"
the mental image will appear.　　

　　And that’s Ask a Teacher. I’m Alice Bryant.
